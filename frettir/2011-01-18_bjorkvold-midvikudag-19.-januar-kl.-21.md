## Green ICT

While the ICT sector holds many of the keys that are essential to a greener economy, the sector is also consuming more and more energy and is responsible for a growing percentage of global carbon emissions.  

With the current interest in Iceland as a location for "greener" data centers and cloud computing services, we aim to take a closer look at the sustainability issues in this industry.  

In this discussion we hope to generate ideas on how we can ensure sustainable development within ICT in the context of Iceland and beyond.  

**Ruth Shortall** is sustainability manager and developer at GreenQloud, an Icelandic company offering green cloud computing services.  

Ruth has worked in both the IT and environmental sectors for several years. She holds a BComm in international commerce with French from University College Dublin, an MSc in computer science from Queen´s Belfast and an MSc in environment and natural resources from Háskoli Islands.
